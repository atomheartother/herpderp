# Installing herpderp for Safari

### From source
Installing from source, if you are not enrolled in Apple's Developer program (and thus have no Safari Extension Certificate), will only work for the lifetime of Safari. You'll need to do this every time you start up Safari, it is therefor recommended to install the binary below.

* Open Extension Builder through `Develop` > `Show Extension Builder`
* Click on `+` > `Add Extension`
* Locate the source code folder called `HerpDerp.safariextension` and open it
* Click `Install`



### From a binary
 Download the binary from [here](/safari/HerpDerp.safariextz) (Thanks to [@gggritso](https://github.com/gggritso) for building it). Simply double click it to install it into Safari.
